Hangtown is the opening round\u00a0of the 12-race Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship sanctioned by the AMA. \n Past Hangtown races have been legendary, with unbelievable battles between Bob Hannah and Marty Smith, Jeremy McGrath and Jeff Emig, and Ricky Carmichael and James Stewart. Other legendary battles were against the track, when in 1991, it rained so hard the first turn was under 4 feet of water with hay bales floating down the track. That race made history, as privateers won both races: Doug Henry in the 125 class and John \"Junkyard\" Dowd in the 250 class. Privateers have not won both races before, or since that fateful Hangtown race in 1991. \nThe late Danny \"Magoo\" Chandler kept Hangtown\u00a0fans at the edge of their seats for years, with a riding style that has not ever \u00a0been duplicated.\u00a0 Bob \"Hurricane\" Hannah graced the crowd with his feet-off-the-pegs style and was a Hangtown favorite. Doug Henry amazed the Hangtown faithful with a convincing win in 1997 aboard the world-changing Yamaha YZ 400 four-stroke. Ricky Carmichael and James Stewart scorched the Hangtown track in 2006 when they battled for 30 minutes straight, and never were more than a few bike-lengths apart. \nEvery year, there is a new battle to witness, and a new legend to be re-told. Perhaps it is the Hangtown mystique\u00a0that\u00a0makes Hangtown racing legendary.\u00a0Many people say that attending Hangtown is a way to be a part of motorcycling history. \nIn 2014,\u00a0the Dirt Diggers North Motorcycle Club, which promotes Hangtown,\u00a0decided to take Hangtown to a new level of professionalism, updating its logo and restructuring how it does business.\u00a0The Club\u00a0began this new era by introducing a new standard for the pro awards. The Club constructed a framed shadow box of Civil-War era revolvers.\u00a0These awards were\u00a0designed to be the best of the best, and Racer X Magazine awarded DDNMC its\u00a0Best Pro Trophy award, given to the race with the best pro awards. DDNMC strives to create the best experience for the racers and fans alike, and 2015 will be no different.  Racing gets underway on Thursday, May 14 at 9am, with some of the best amateurs in the country doing battle. Amateur racing continues into Friday, May 15 at 9am, when the top experts and Pro Am's compete for pro points, which leads to a professional license in the premier professional series. This years marks the return of the WMX, the professional women's MX series. Their first moto will be on Saturday the 15th. \nOn Saturday, May 16, the top pros in the world hit the track for timed practice and qualifying around 8:30am.\u00a0Opening ceremonies start\u00a0at 12:25pm and racing gets underway at 1pm. The women's WMX second moto will get underway at that time. At 2 pm,\u00a0the\u00a0pros\u00a0take to the track.\u00a0A full action-packed day from sunup to sundown!

They also have great frustration with the slow and ineffective manner with which the successive governments they look up to with anticipation have mishandled the actualization of their aspirations.  \nStatistical report from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that over 70% of our youth are currently unemployed. It is our belief that the more the youths are empowered, the less the crime rate in the society.  \nNigerian youths have great aspirations and expectations. They also have great frustration with the slow and ineffective manner with which the successive governments they look up to with anticipation have mishandled the actualization of their aspirations.  \nBy this National Youth Empowerment Summit, we are forming a formidable force to lead the unemployed for gainful employment, and to cut short the misconstruing of laudable government empowerment initiatives, placing the government in a better position to understand the needs of her people and address it fairly and adequately, without the constraints suffered from the hands of middle men who hijacks the fruits of youth empowerment for their selfish interest.  \nThis National Youth Empowerment Summit will give true meaning to youth\u2019s creative talents and labour power.  \nOur hope lies in creativity, empowerment, skill acquisition and development. Acquiring the needed skills will make our people (youth especially) more creative, resourceful and less destructive. The transformation of Nigeria cannot be achieved without empowerment of the youth.  \nOur Skill development and Vocational programs aims to achieve this, by increasing the ability of youth and the society at large to contribute their quota to the society while generating income and creating jobs.  \nThe Concerned Youth Empowerment Association of Nigeria was founded in 2011. As a patriotic Youth organization, membership is drawn from the six geo \u2013 political zones of the federation.  \nWe work to ensure that Nigerian youth are duly contained in congenial democratic atmosphere devoid of violence, by reducing youth\u2019s restiveness and unemployment through our Skill and Agricultural Empowerment development programmes for gainful employment.  \nIt is our belief that the more the youths are empowered, the less the crime rate in the society.  \nWe therefore see it appropriate and affording to give hope to the actualization of youth\u2019s aspirations through Job Creation and Skill Acquisition, and to lead them to benefit more from President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\u2019s Empowerment Initiatives, by sending this Summit to their doorstep for gainful employment. \nThe Summit Structure:  \nTHE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE SUMMIT  \n\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To develop youth that are creative and contributive to the socio \u2013 economic sector of the country  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To equip people with necessary skills for self \u2013 reliance  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To give meaningful and relevant knowledge in Agribusiness, Entrepreneurship and information Technology  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ability to apply business knowledge to everyday life  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To provide consultancy services and start \u2013 up capital for participants  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To enlist the unemployed youths looking for white collar job for gainful employment.  \n\u00a0 \nSPECIAL FOCUS  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 YOUTH  \nTARGET AUDIENCE  \n\u00a0 \n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Youth  \n\u00a0 \n\nParticipation: The participants are the Nigerian youth on this Summit website, free of any cost. http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-concerned-youth-empowerment-association-of-nigeria-7841290481 \nArrangement: Training And Empowerment: \n\n\u00a0 \n\nThe summit will have four days training for youth farmers to be adequately prepared for next farming season and have the full knowledge of agribusiness , and further assist them in securing the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\u2019s soft loan (NIRSAL: Nigeria Incentive \u2013 Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural lending) for farmers without request for collateral. \nThe Summit will enlist youths to be trained on a free vocational training at Industrial Training Fund , on the following Vocational Trades: Cake Production/ Pastries, Bread Production, Event Management, Solar Panels / Inverter Installation, Maintenance and Repairs, Plumbing and Tilling, Refrigeration and Air conditioning, Domestic & Industrial Wiring, Computer Maintenance and Networking, and further facilitate the securing of loan from the Bank of Industry to provide the needed machines for their establishment. \nEnlistment of Graduates for White Collar Job Employment: Graduates looking for white collar jobs are to submit their details online (the summit website) for gainful employment through: The Presidential Job Creation Board headed by the Vice President of this federation, with the mandate to create at least three million jobs in a year, and for inclusion into the Graduate Internship Scheme. \nThe fifth day is set aside to confer on His Excellency President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan with the Leadership Award of the Grand Commander of Youth Empowerment, together with other Nigerian Leaders."}}, {"pk": 5199, "model": "polls.Eve", "fields": {"category": "199", "name": "Emerce Digital Marketing Live", "description": "H\u00e9t grootste event van de Benelux op het gebied van online advertising en marketing komt eraan!
